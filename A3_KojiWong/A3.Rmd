#Links to an external site.Non-thresholded Gene set Enrichment Analysis

## Conduct non-thresholded gene set enrichment analysis using the ranked set of genes from Assignment #2.

> Q1. What method did you use? What genesets did you use? Make sure to specify versions and cite your methods.
Summarize your enrichment results.



> Q2. How do these results compare to the results from the thresholded analysis in Assignment #2. Compare qualitatively. Is this a straight forward comparison? Why or why not?
